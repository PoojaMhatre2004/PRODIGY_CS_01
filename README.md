# Caesar Cipher Program

A simple Python program to encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar cipher method. This project allows users to encrypt a message by shifting its characters and decrypt it back using the same shift value.

## Features
- Encrypt a message using a Caesar cipher.
- Decrypt a message that was encrypted using a Caesar cipher.
- Simple and user-friendly command-line interface.

## How It Works
The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. Non-alphabetic characters are not shifted.
#The program allows users to:
1. Enter a message to encrypt.
2. Enter a message to decrypt.
3. Exit the program.

## Usage
### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.

### Running the Program
1. Clone the repository:
 ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/caesar-cipher.git
 ```
